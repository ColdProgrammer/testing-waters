WARNING: Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) are restricted,
check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict.

Samples in kernel functions may not be resolved if a suitable vmlinux
file is not found in the buildid cache or in the vmlinux path.

Samples in kernel modules won't be resolved at all.

If some relocation was applied (e.g. kexec) symbols may be misresolved
even with a suitable vmlinux or kallsyms file.

Cannot read kernel map
Error:
The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument) for event (MEM_LOAD_L3_MISS_RETIRED.LOCAL_DRAM_PS).
/bin/dmesg may provide additional information.
